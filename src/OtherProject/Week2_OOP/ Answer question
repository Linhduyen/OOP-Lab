In Java, you cannot create two constructor methods with the same parameter types,  as it leads to ambiguity. For instance, if you have one constructor to build a DVD by title, and you attempt to create another constructor to build a DVD by category using the same parameter type (String), Java considers them as the same method due to their identical parameter types. This results in a compilation error because Java cannot distinguish between the two constructors based solely on their parameter types. Therefore, you'll need to use different parameter types or method signatures to avoid this conflict.
